# Stock-Price-Trend-Prediction-LSTM
Predicting the trend of a company stock by using Long Short Term memory (LSTM) 

## What I built
In this Project, I will build a Python deep learning model that will predict the future behavior of stock prices. 
I assume that you are familiar with the concepts of deep learning in Python, especially RNN and Long Short-Term Memory.
While predicting the actual price of a stock is an uphill climb,
we can build a model that will predict whether the price will go up or down. 


## Further enhancements can be done by considering the following
It’s important to note that there are always other factors that affect the prices of stocks,
such as the political atmosphere and the market. However, we won’t focus on those factors for this tutorial.
